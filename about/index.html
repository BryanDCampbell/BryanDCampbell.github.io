<div class="blurb">
	<h2>I'm a Computer Science student at Towson University.</h2>
	<h2>Before I discovered my interest in programming I was pursuing a career in nursing. I started my career as a Licensed Practical Nurse at a pediatric hospital in Baltimore. As I continued through my community college's nursing program to become a Registered Nurse, I realized that my interests were consistently being drawn toward nursing informatics. The further I delved into research on the subject, the more I felt that I was on the wrong side of the field. </h2>
	<h2>After consulting with a good friend whose judgement I trust, I came to the decision to pursue programming in earnest. Every step from that point forward has lead to here and now with you viewing my portfolio.</h2>
	<h2> When I'm not studying or hard at work, I play videogames, explore walking trails in nearby parks, discover new places to eat in Baltimore, and obsess a little too much over fantasy football.</h2>
