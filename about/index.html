<div class="blurb">
	<h3>I'm a Computer Science student at Towson University.</h3>
	<h3>Before I discovered my interest in programming I was pursuing a career in nursing. I've earned my nursing license and started my career as an LPN at a pediatric hospital in Baltimore. As I continued through a community college nursing program to become an RN, I realized that my interests were consistently being drawn toward nursing informatics. The further I delved into research on the subject, the more I felt that I was on the wrong side of the field. </h3>
	<h3>After consulting with a good friend who's judgement I trust, I came to the decision to pursue programming in earnest. Every step from that point forward has lead to here and now with you viewing my portfolio.</h3>
	<h3> In my downtime I play videogames, </h3>
	<h3>go for walks/hikes in nearby parks,</h3>
	<h4>discover new places to eat in Baltimore, </h4>
	<h5>and obsess a little too much over fantasy football.</h5>
	<h6>Just to see what it looks like</h6>
